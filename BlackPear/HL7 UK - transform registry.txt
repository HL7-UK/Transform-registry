Hi Robert,

As promised, content for the HL7 UK transform project! 

Black Pear provide a FHIR API allowing patient search on PDS. Internally, this 
uses the NHS SMSP endpoint to retrieve patient details from PDS, with the ITK 
response transformed to FHIR Patient search results.

This is a subset of the regression test cases for the service - it may be of 
use to other organisations needing to transform SMSP results to FHIR. Black 
Pear is happy for this to be shared via the HL7 UK registry.

Cheers,
Dunmail
